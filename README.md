# Gesture Volume Control Using OpenCV and MediaPipe

This project provides a simple yet powerful way to control your computer's volume through hand gestures. By leveraging the capabilities of OpenCV for image processing and MediaPipe for hand detection, it offers a unique interaction model where the distance between the thumb and index finger is used to adjust the volume. This README guides you through setting up, using, and customizing the project.

## Features

- Real-time detection of hand gestures using a webcam.
- Volume control by changing the distance between the thumb and index finger.
- Visual feedback for gesture recognition and current volume level.

- Python 3.x
- A webcam connected to your computer.

### Installation
